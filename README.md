# Unexpected Route Matching or Rendering Issues in React Router Dom

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Router Dom v6 related to unexpected route matching or rendering issues.  The bug specifically occurs when navigating between routes with dynamic segments or nested routes.  The provided code illustrates the problem and a solution.

## Bug Description

The initial implementation uses `react-router-dom` to define routes. However, under certain navigation scenarios (e.g., rapid transitions, interaction with dynamic segments), the component rendering does not behave as expected.  This could manifest as incorrect components rendering, blank screens, or inconsistent route matching.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing route definitions to avoid ambiguity and employing appropriate route matching strategies, potentially with additional safeguards or improved route handling.
